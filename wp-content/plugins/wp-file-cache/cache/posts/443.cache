Sofa or chaise-lounge?

Akka is both! This flexible "Moving Moments Seat" changes from an intimate two seat sofa 
into a chaise-lounge for pleasant moments of relaxation. In order to achieve this versatility, 
designer Stefan Heiliger created a rotating seat that also changes the look and function of 
the Akka. Its sophistication is in the choice of rotating point ensuring that the symmetry is 
not disturbed, whilst the corner in which it is placed guarantees perfect comfort in either 
position. The curved back offers good support for the two-seat sofa and provides a safe haven 
for those sitting peacefully on the Akka. A compact two-in-one piece of furniture, small in 
size but big in design!";s:10:"post_title";s:4:"Akka";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:4:"akka";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2011-10-17 20:49:02";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2011-10-17 20:49:02";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:73:"http://inspirationfurniture.digicoyote.net/?post_type=products&#038;p=443";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:8:"products";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:9:"ancestors";a:0:{}s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}
