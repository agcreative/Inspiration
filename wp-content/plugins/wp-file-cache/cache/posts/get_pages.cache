How can I remove them?</h2>
The white spots are condensate caused by something too hot, cold or wet having been placed on the table. The moisture being unable to get away has simply penetrated the lacquer and created the white spots. However, there is something you can do. Simply use a powerful hairdryer and move it in circles, 5-10 cm above the spot. Remember not to hold the hairdryer still, as the heat may damage the lacquer. The heat from the hairdryer will dry out and thus remove the condensed water underneath the lacquer. This however may take a while - perhaps half an hour or more, so please be patient.
We recommend that you ALWAYS use placemats when using your table. Also it is necessary to use coasters when placing hot items on your table.

<h2>Should I be concerned if my new leather furniture has small lines or blemishes on the surface?</h2>
Markings such as scars, insect bites, wrinkles, veining are natural characteristics of genuine leather. Corrected leathers which have been protected and finished to create a consistent, uniform look and feel- then you will see fewer marks. However, a natural leather will show more natural markings, such as insect bites, scars and stretch marks, as well as colour variations. These colour variations can occur within the same hide because there is no finish applied to give the look of consistent colour as there is in a corrected hide. This is an indication of the authenticity of the leather, and should not be considered a defect. Actually, it should be treated as a "mark" of true, high quality leather.

<h2>I have pets and I don't want my dog or cat to damage the leather with its claws, what should I do?</h2>
If you are worried about your pets damaging leather you should look at the most appropriate leather for a home with pets. You probably should go with a protected finish leather because it is more easily repaired. Repairs are also likely to be less noticeable because of the color finishing that is applied to this family of leather.

<h2>Why is one leather grade more expensive than another?</h2>
The main determining factor of a grade of leather is the origin of the raw hide. Hides from the Southern Hemisphere are more abundant and tend to show more of the natural characteristics of leather. They are less supple than hides from the Northern Hemisphere. Generally speaking, the higher grades of leather come from hides raised in the Northern Hemisphere. Hides come from all over the world, and are classified into categories based on their origin. Then they are sorted by the amount of natural characteristics that are present on the hide. Since hides with fewer characteristics are rarer, they usually are more expensive, and require less processing to complete the leather. Hides from the Southern Hemisphere usually represent the majority of all hides. These hides, by their origin, have more natural characteristics and will show more variation in color. This is not a defect.

<h2>Why can the price of leather furniture vary so much?</h2>
A very important part of the final product's price is based on the leather's characteristics. As grades of leather increase, the cost of the final product also increases. However there are many other factors that affect pricing including: dimension, style, leg type and stitching details. 

<h2>How can I care for my leather upholstery?</h2>
We recommend cleaning it using a neutral soap diluted with water. Use a dry, soft and white cloth. We do not recommend any type of conditioner, or chemical to be placed on the sofa. Simply dusting the sofa, and cleaning up spots when they occur should help keep your sofa looking good for its expected life. Remember that leather is a natural material that can change its appearance as it ages.
