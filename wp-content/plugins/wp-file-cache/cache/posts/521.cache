A new piece of furniture of synthetic and minimalist concept that varies and transform 
into a seat made of a single piece of steel. The maximum resistance estimated to deformation 
is from 200 kg, although the extension varies according to the sitting and the place where 
the extension force is applied. The weight of this design has been calculated in 100 kg, 
but it has a direct connection with the safety of the product depending on the function 
and use given to this piece. The weight is a resultant of shape, material, adaptation of 
human figure and mechanism. (Also available in green.)
